In this website I'm going to demonstrate how the changing of the seasons on the weather. For that I'll use 4 graphs: time-temperature, time-pressure, time-humidity, and time-rain. For that I'll use the datas for 2023 and 2024.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

vazgen <-read.csv("vazgen.csv")
```



```{r}
vazgen |>  
   ggplot(aes(x =temperature )) + 
geom_histogram(binwidth = 15) + 
   labs(title = "Time and Temperature", 
        x = "Temperature",
        y = "Count")

```
